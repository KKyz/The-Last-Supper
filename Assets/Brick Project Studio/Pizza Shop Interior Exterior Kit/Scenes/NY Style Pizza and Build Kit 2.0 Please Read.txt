Thank you so much for purchasing the new NY Style Pizza and Build Kit Ver 2.0!

This package is the first of many Build kits that will allow you to build your own scene towards specific themes in a modern scenario.  

The Build Kit is made based off a grid system X, Z, Y  Walls & Floors of 2.5 X 2.5 X 4, you can use Unity’s progrids to assist building.

The Interior walls sit on top of the interor floors in order to have a nice seamless fit.

I have included a demo scene of one structure and a showcase to show off the props and the interior and exterior textures.

I am looking to build the tools for the developers to create a whole world, I would love to feature your scenes on my website.  

Send me screen shots on your creations to sojaexiles@support.com with your unity user name so I can give proper credit.

This package has working doors, pizza boxes, the oven opens up as well,  So click away while you browse.

When you use a new prefab with a working script, you need to link the player to the script ot make the doors and windows work, this tells the script what can open the doors and windows.  I have included a PDF document called Prefab Doors so you can see how to link it.

********Please rate the package ********

it really helps support my direction on creating new content and better content, and if you have any ideas on my next package or how to improve this package, please send me an email.

Thanks!
