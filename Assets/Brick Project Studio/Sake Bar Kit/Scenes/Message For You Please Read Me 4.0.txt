Thank you very much for purchasing or updating the new Sake Glassware Prop Pack and Modular Build Kit

Ver 4.0 is huge!

I hope you enjoy using these assets as much as I enjoyed producing them.  

The Package has been upgraded to a build kit with 12 Interior Textures and 6 Exterior Textures that allow you to build a structure from the bottom up.

The Build Kit is made based off a grid system X, Z, Y  Walls & Floors of 2.5 X 2.5 X 4, you can use Unity’s progrids to assist building.

The Interior walls sit on top of the interor floors in order to have a nice seamless fit.

A number of brand new textures, brand new and revised materials, optimized and a vast amount of brand new models have been added.

If you already own the package or are purchasing it brand new, I would greatly appreciate it if you could take a minute to rate and review my package, your feedback encourages me to create new and bigger packages.
